***

This project is a restaurant reviews website.

#### About this project
I was provided a starter code with a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all.

I had to convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also had to convert this to a Progressive Web Application by caching some assets for offline use.

#### How to run this project
